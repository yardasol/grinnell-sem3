Place the green/white thermocouple connections up and off the surface of the table so that cold LN2 boiloff will not change the temperature from ambient (we've been using a foam block).  We are relying upon keeping the temperature of these junctions near room temperature, 22 C, or 295 K.  If the room temperature is significantly different from this value, you'll need to change a line of code in the cell block below--just search for 295 to find the line of code.\n",

If it doesn't work, you might need to power both boxes off, then on.  And if this program doesn't run, try going to Kernel/Restart & Clear Output.

The other plots Temperature vs. Data Count.  At the end of the data run, which happens after MAX_COUNT is reached, the displays will remain static until you close them.  You'll know when the run has finished because the marker in the Data Count plot will stop on the right-hand side.  And now it beeps.\n",
