    "You'll need to run the cells in order before scanning the monochromator with the Acquire Data cell.  In the Acquire Data section you'll get a chance to change the filename to which you save the data, the start and end wavelengths, the scan rate, and the diffraction grating order.  You can repeatedly go back to scanning by using the Acquire Data cell, or you can park the monochromator at the highest feature with the Optimize Signal cell and adjust the slits or lens position in order to get the biggest signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optics:  Our Acton 0.3 m monochrometers have an aperture ratio of f/4, which is a measure of the acceptance angle of the bundle of light rays as they enter the monochromator.  Imagine a cone of diameter D (the lens aperture) focusing down to the slit over distance L.  The half angle of the cone is such that $\\tan(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) = \\frac{D/2}{L} = \\frac{1}{2F}$, where $F$ is the f-number.  So our f/4 gives an acceptance (half) angle of 7.1 $^\\circ$.  If the light comes in at a steeper angle you overfill the grating and cause stray light.  If the light comes at too shallow an angle, you won't illuminate as many grooves on the grating and you suffer reduced spectral resolution.  If we use the \"gold\" lens with a focal length of around 75 mm in the 1:1 imaging configuration (image size is same as object size) we slightly overfill the grating.  If you work it out, our optimum input would put the lens about 200 mm from the slit, and the lamp 125 mm from the lens.  None of this is too critical in today's experiment.  For best throughput no matter the image size, focus an image of the lamp onto the slits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artifacts:  although these tubes are filled with pure hydrogen or a hydrogen/deuterium mixture,there may be inpurities present.  You may see some broad features due to molecular H2, D2 or HD, if you look in the cooler parts of the lamp.  And don't be concerned that your eyes are playing tricks on you:  the tubes will look red due to the strong Balmer alpha line near 656 nm.  The strongest peak recorded will be in the blue (486 nm) because that's where the photomultiplier tube is most sensitive."

Do this iteratively, because you might miss the peak entirely if the monochromator is set for the wrong wavelength.  Cut the slit widths in half and then repeat the scanning cell.  Bump up the high voltage by 100 V.  Remember to scan more slowly so as not to miss the peak between data points.  At 5 microns on the slits, scanning over a 2 nm wide region, you'll want maybe 0.05 nm/point.  At 1 second between points, that's a scan rate of 3 nm/minute.  \n",

These Acton monochromators can be scanned up to 1400 nm in first order, which means you can see the 656 nm line in 2nd order, (656\\*2 < 1400) or the 434 line in 2nd or 3rd order (434\\*3)< 1400.\n",

    "### <font color='blue'>WAVELENGTH CONVERSION (vac to air or air to vac) using ref_index.  Recall that the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen atom is a statement about $\\it energy~levels$, not wavelengths.  We measure wavelengths in air, where the index of refraction is not quite 1.0 (It's about 1.0003, but even that number varies a little bit with wavelength, air temperature, humidity and even the carbon dioxide in your breath!)  So before converting from wavelength into frequency via $f = c/\\lambda$, we really ought to convert what are referred to as \"air wavelengths\" into \"vacuum wavelengths\" by multiplying by the index of refraction at that wavelength.  Fortunately, someone has created a handy couple of conversions to simplify this task:"
