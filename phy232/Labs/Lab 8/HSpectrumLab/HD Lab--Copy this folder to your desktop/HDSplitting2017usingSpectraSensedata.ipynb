    "Optics: Our Acton 0.3 m monochrometers have an aperture ratio of f/4, which is a measure of the acceptance angle of the bundle of light rays as they enter the monochromator. Imagine a cone of diameter D (the lens aperture) focusing down to the slit over distance L. The half angle of the cone is such that tan(θ2)=D/2L=12Ftan⁡(θ2)=D/2L=12F, where FF is the f-number. So our f/4 gives an acceptance (half) angle of 7.1 $^\\circ$. If the light comes in at a steeper angle you overfill the grating and cause stray light. If the light comes at too shallow an angle, you won't illuminate as many grooves on the grating and you suffer reduced spectral resolution. If we use the \"gold\" lens with a focal length of around 75 mm in the 1:1 imaging configuration (image size is same as object size) we slightly overfill the grating. If you work it out, our optimum input would put the lens about 200 mm from the slit, and the lamp 125 mm from the lens. None of this is too critical in today's experiment. For best throughput no matter the image size, focus an image of the lamp onto the slits.\n",

    "Artifacts: although these tubes are filled with pure hydrogen or a hydrogen/deuterium mixture,there may be inpurities present. You may see some broad features due to molecular H2, D2 or HD, if you look in the cooler parts of the lamp. And don't be concerned that your eyes are playing tricks on you: the tubes will look red due to the strong Balmer alpha line near 656 nm. The strongest peak recorded will be in the blue (486 nm) because that's where the photomultiplier tube is most sensitive."

    "## <font color='blue'> ACQUIRE DATA.  The easiest way to get a quick scan with the SpectraSense software is to select \"Survey\".  Look at the bottom of this cell to learn how to save a spectrum.  See the separate Word document on using SpectraSense. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scanning is best done with room lights off, otherwise you'll get Hg and even Na lines from the fluorescent tubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical voltages on the photomultiplier tube are -400 V or -500 V  for wide slits, and -1000 V for narrow slits.  Slit spacing needs to be around 100-250 microns for coarse (10-25 on micrometers), fast scanning (50-100 nm/min), or 10-30 (1-3 little units on micrometers) microns for high-resolution scanning at 1-2 nm/min.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To guide your choice, bear in mind that the monochromator should always have its entrance and exit slits set at the same width.  Each turn of the dial is 25 counts, or 250 microns.  Clockwise makes the slits open up; counterclockwise makes them close.  At 0 they are held apart by an internal stop.\n",
    "### The approximate resolution of the monochromators at various slit spacings is\n",
    "#### 5 microns:  0.1 nm\n",
    "#### 150 microns: 0.7 nm\n",
    "#### 500 microns:  2 nm\n",
    "#### 1000 microns:  4 nm\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice compromise for a survey scan is around 150 microns, so the visible light range (300-700 nm) can be captured adequately if each data point is spaced around 0.5 nm from the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to zoom in and get a high resolution scan, you'll need to narrow the slits.  Do this iteratively, because you might miss the peak entirely if the monochromator is set for the wrong wavelength.  Cut the slit widths in half and then repeat the scanning cell.  Bump up the high voltage by 100 V.  Remember to scan more finely so as not to miss the peak between data points.  At 5 microns on the slits, scanning over a 2 nm wide region, you'll want maybe 0.05 nm/point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want even higher resolution, you might set the GRATING_ORDER to 2, which simply means that you set the monochromator to scan at twice the wavelength.  Because the dispersion of a diffraction grating increases with angle (recall that the second m = 2 spectrum is more spread out than m = 1), you'll get better resolution.  These Acton monochromators can be scanned up to 1400 nm in first order, which means you can see the 656 nm line in 2nd order, (656\\*2 < 1400) or the 434 line in 2nd or 3rd order (434\\*3)< 1400.\n",

Recall that the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen atom is a statement about $\\it energy~levels$, not wavelengths.  We measure wavelengths in air, where the index of refraction is not quite 1.0 (It's about 1.0003, but even that number varies a little bit with wavelength.)  So before converting from wavelength into frequency via $f = c/\\lambda$, we really ought to convert what are referred to as \"air wavelengths\" into \"vacuum wavelengths\" by multiplying by the index of refraction at that wavelength.
