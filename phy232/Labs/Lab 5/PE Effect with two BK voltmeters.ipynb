    "### Notebook to use 2 or more B&K DMMs at the same time and collect data from all B&Ks\n",
    "### Mod Lab application:  Photoelectric Effect lab, measure stopping voltage and photocurrent\n",
    "###  \n",
    "#### Recommendation:  Turn on PE box and voltmeters for at least 20 minutes before taking data.  Typically it takes 30 minutes for instruments and power supplies to stabilize thermally.  When taking data, you'll get better results scanning from high stopping voltage toward low, because the photocurrents are smaller, causing less heating of the electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You need to direct the light from the laser pointer straight into the opening in the electronics (PE Effect) box.  The best way to see that you are on target is to dial the stopping voltage down to zero and view the photocurrent signal.  To either side it will be very large.  Dead in the middle you will get a very small signal, because there is a mask inside that prevents light from falling directly on the anode (which would give you a reverse PE effect that we don't want to look at today), and that mask will also block the light from falling on the photocathode.  Just direct the light to either side, where you get a large photocurrent.  Zero the meter with the Zero knob, then turn the voltage all the way up and you should see the signal go away.  \n",
    "#### When you actually take data you'll want to dial the knob slowly in some places and quickly in others, because we care mostly about the transition between essentially no photocurrent and just a tiny bit of photocurrent.  Because of the slow data rate of the DMMs, you'll want to make sure to give the meters enough time to settle at each voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work in semi-darkness to minimize stray light. Room lights, or light from your computer will give some contaminating wavelengths.   A cardboard tube should block room lights effectively.  It might be a nice idea to run a scan with the laser turned off in order to see that your baseline is at most a gently sloped straight line (due to differential heating in the circuitry causing baseline drift).  Then when you direct the diffused laser light, you'll see that the baseline shifts a bit, because the laser light heats the photcathode ever so gently.  Allow a couple of minutes for this baseline to settle.  Optionally, you can zero out the baseline again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestion: reduce the size of this notebook window, and place it in the upper right hand corner of your screen.  The live plot of your data will appear in the upper left hand corner, rather than get lost beneath the Jupyter notebook icon in the taskbar."
